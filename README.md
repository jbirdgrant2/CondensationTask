# CondensationTask
This is a task containing two condensation animations (see condensation8.html and condensation10.html).
Each animation page contains three buttons to show/hide various descriptions of the animation itself -- long description, short description, and tactile tours.
The buttons are web components, as are the descriptions themselves.

Notes:
These pages have been tested in Chrome only.

For proper display and functionality of the web components, you must run the pages from a server.
You can see them in action here:
